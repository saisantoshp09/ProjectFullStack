# Project Name

## Description
This project is a web application built using a **React** front-end and a **Django** back-end. The application enables users to make reservations, view all reservations, and manage data efficiently.

### Front-End
The front-end of the application is developed using **React**. It provides users with an intuitive interface to make reservations, view data, and interact with the application.

### Back-End
The back-end is built using **Django**, a high-level Python web framework that handles the business logic, database management, and API integration.

## Features
- **Reservation System**: Users can make reservations by submitting their details, date, time, and number of guests.
- **View Reservations**: Admins can view all reservations in a tabular format.
- **Scalable Architecture**: The application is built to handle increasing traffic with a robust architecture.
- **Security**: The application utilizes HTTPS, secure database connections, and proper authentication to ensure data protection.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js and npm** (for React)
- **Python 3.x** (for Django)
